This Angular project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.5.

## App Hosting

This project is hosted for free on the GitHub Pages. If I have any app changes I execute following commands: 
- to build a dist folder with a production code: `ng build --prod`
- to create CNAME file with custom url reference: `echo "movadee.com" > dist/CNAME`
- to publish site on github pages: `ngh`

I used [angular-cli-ghpages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-cli-ghpages) to publish Angular2+ app to gh-pages

## App Specifications Document

I was inspired by Mr. Joel Spolski and his amazing book Joel on Software to write this [Project Specs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eTpdydbdG0UwS-yy14mLAFd8VkwStVFrw6QwhR4-yTI/edit?usp=sharings).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
